# NBody
January 2018, CS201 (Data Structures and Algorithms) Assignment #1

This was the first assignment for my CS201 class in fall of 2018. Here are the instructions: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fZYZdzaa1d9djfmwOFA2ZQEKNJmyC97wJ4e6RP_kAPw/edit?usp=sharing

"In this assignment, you will write a program to simulate the motion of N objects in a plane, mutually affected by gravitational forces, and animate the results. Such methods are widely used in cosmology, semiconductors, and fluid dynamics to study complex physical systems. Ultimately, you will be creating a program NBody.java that draws an animation of bodies floating around in space tugging on each other with the power of gravity."
